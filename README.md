# 🧪 ChEMBL Database Drug Discovery for RET Tyrosine Kinase Receptor in Neuroblastoma

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to identify potential drug candidates for inhibiting the **RET tyrosine kinase receptor**, a key target in **neuroblastoma**, using data-driven approaches. By leveraging the **ChEMBL database**, we retrieve relevant bioactivity data, build **Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) machine learning models**, and predict potential inhibitors.

## 🏗️ Methodology
1. **Data Retrieval & Preprocessing** 📊
   - Extract **bioactivity data** for RET inhibitors from the **ChEMBL database**.
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset (removing missing values, normalizing features, etc.).
2. **Feature Engineering** 🛠️
   - Convert molecular structures into numerical descriptors (e.g., chemical fingerprints, physicochemical properties).
3. **Model Development** 🤖
   - Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) for QSAR analysis.
   - Evaluate model performance using **accuracy, ROC-AUC, and other metrics**.
4. **Prediction & Analysis** 🔬
   - Use the trained model to predict novel RET inhibitors.
   - Analyze results and identify promising drug candidates.

## 📈 Results & Findings
- The best-performing model achieved **high accuracy and specificity** in identifying potential RET inhibitors.
- Key molecular descriptors influencing RET inhibition were identified.
- The workflow successfully predicted novel drug candidates for further validation.

## 🔮 Future Work
- **Deep learning** for enhanced drug discovery.
- **Experimental validation** of top predicted inhibitors.
- **Integration with docking simulations** for improved candidate ranking.
